# maahi's corner

internet corners are pretty cool. ice cream is too. so i made myself a cozy corner on the world wide web for swirl! go check out the [website!](https://maahis-corner.vercel.app/)

## some cool stuff to watch out for (aka features for scoops):
- SCOOP 1:
    - a footer.
    - a 404 page.
    - link to external websites (my projects, my github, hackclub, and swirl).
- SCOOP 2:
    - special link (email and discord).
    - special text formatting (both html formatting tags and css styling).
    - html list.
- SCOOP 3:
    - custom imported font (iceland).
    - html button on 404 page.
    - html audio (plays cat meow on clicking cat pfp).
- SCOOP 4:
    - css :hover and :focus pseudos (links, buttons and input boxes).
    - a header.
    - use of hr, input, and button tags, stylised.
- SCOOP 5:
    - reveal of secret cipher on button click.
    - on three clicks, input box for message is revealed. on clicking enter, the cat reacts with a message.
    - screenshots of my projects beside the description using flex. flex is also used in footer.

of course, i have no clue of the validity of some of these features, and i might've missed some, so i have no clue how many scoops it'll result to!
